## Introduction :green_book:

> AppServiceNLD was an app made for Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas' citizens looking for job or, not common services 


## What AppService is able to do? :question: 

> Users could be able to publish any kind of their services, stores, garages, and whatever type of business in the city. They had their own profile where they could see their own services,  and information such as a profile photo, phone number, name and surname, etc. Firebase made possible to see at real time what users had put at the moment, and see a real time changes in services and all of its components (like service's photo or number). In the begining, AppService had been developed just for Nuevo Laredo, but my development team tought about distribute AppService arround MÃ©xico and even the world! I'm working on it, see more at AppService made with React Native :) ...

## Programming :computer:

> Made for Android with Java. Firebase used as backend service (real time database, storage and authentication)
